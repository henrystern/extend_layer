### Purpose
* Inspired by Dreymar's extend layer this script focuses on left hand keyboard navigation and right hand mouse navigation. 
* This configuration provides superior control while the right hand is on the mouse without compromising home row performance.

### Customization
* Customization should be self explanatory from the comments and the [AHK keylist](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm)
* I recommend using the alphanumeric keycodes so the extend layer works consistently regardless of layout.

### Startup
* Win+r 'shell:startup'
* Place a shortcut to the script in the startup folder.
